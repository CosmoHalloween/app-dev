## Perfect Blue
A 1997 movie that follows a woman named *Mima Kirigoe* who is an idol that left her group to pursue acting. With her leaving that old life behind, there are certain people who can't accept the fact that her *good-girl* image has now been dirtied by show business. Her stalker being one of the biggest obstacle in her privacy, with the man making a website pretending to be her. This movie is unique because it shows our main character losing sanity and not being able to differentiate reality and fantasy. Often seeing her reflection mocking her and disappearing by hoping on streetlights or even thinking that her reflection was trying to murder her when it was just her manager wearing her former clothes when she was still an idol. 

The two antagonists are the people closest to her:
1. Stalker (One of the people who guards their performance and her 'biggest' fan)
2. Rumi Hidaka (Mima's manager and a former idol who she tells everything to) 


She overcomes all of the obstacles in her way and becomes the actress she always wanted to be, but the ending has always been thought as creepy by the viewers.
